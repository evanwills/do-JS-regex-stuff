			What <em>Expose the chickens</em> does
		</h1>
		<p>
			Did you know that vowels are actually chickens in disguise? Well they are! (It's true!!!)
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don't believe me, then follow these simple steps:
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li>
			Paste some text into "Text to be modified" text area
		</li>
		<li>
			Decide what year the chickens were hatched
		</li>
		<li>
			Decide what gender the chickens are
		</li>
		<li>
			Check all the relevant moods
		</li>
		<li>
			Click the "Modify input" button <em>(bottom left)</em>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			It will expose the vowels for what they really are. Chickens!!!
