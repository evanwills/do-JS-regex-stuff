# What _Expose the chickens_ does

Did you know that vowels are actually chickens in disguise? Well they are!!! (It's true!!!)

If you don't believe me, then follow these simple steps:

1. Paste some text into "Text to be modified" text area
2. Decide what year the chickens were hatched 
3. Deside what gender the chickens are
4. Check all the relevent modes
5. Click on "Modify input"

It will expose the vowels for what they really are.
